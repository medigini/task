# Golang GraphQL API with Fiber & BigCache

1. This project has **GraphQL service** that fetches materials from an external **REST API**.  
   Since the material API returns different results on each request, we call it **5 times** to collect all available materials.
2. The **GraphQL logic** is fully implemented inside the `api/graphql` folder, making it modular and **future-ready for gRPC or REST API integration**.
